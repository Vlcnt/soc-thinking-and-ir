# SOC Thinking and Incident Reports

Experience-free SOC thinking: decision logic, boundaries, and incident reports.

## What this repository is

This repository demonstrates **how I think as a SOC analyst**, not how many years of experience I claim.

It focuses on:
- evidence-first analysis
- explicit decision boundaries
- risk-aware judgment
- clear separation between facts, assumptions, and unknowns

## What this repository is NOT

- Not a collection of tools or scripts
- Not a SIEM or detection engineering project
- Not a claim of professional SOC experience

All scenarios are **lab-based or simulated** and are used to demonstrate analytical thinking.

## Repository structure

- `reports/`  
  Incident reports documenting what happened, what can be proven, and how decisions were made.

  Full incident report for a suspicious PowerShell execution.

- `reports/IR-001-decision-log.md`  
  Decision log showing how escalation, closure, and risk were evaluated.

2. Then read **IR-001-decision-log.md**

The incident report shows *what happened*.  
The decision log shows *how and why decisions were made*.
